# learningcode
Recording my coding experience. I will be using CodeAcademy Pro to complete the full-stack engineer career path. 

It is December 4, 2022 and I am beginning the "100 days of code" challenge. 
For 100 days at least, I will spend an hour a day on coding. I'll share my thoughts / learnings in my newsletter (found on my twitter), and here on GitHub is where I will share all technical data from my projects. 

At the time of writing this, I am a beginner to web development and most coding language in general (knows a bit of SQL). I believe learning languages like javascript, CSS, HTML, and python will provide me with the essential tools that I need to build my vision.

I hope for this to assist me in my learning and for it to provide some value to you you as well.
