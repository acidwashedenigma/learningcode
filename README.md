# learningcode
Recording my coding experience. 

It is December 4, 2022 and I am beginning the "100 days of code" challenge. 
For 100 days at least, I will spend an hour a day on coding. I'll share my thoughts / learnings in my newsletter (found on my twitter), and here on GitHub is where I will share all technical data from my projects. 

I will be using CodeAcademy Pro to complete the Full-stack engineer career path. 

I hope for this to assist me in my learning and for it to provide some value to you you as well.
